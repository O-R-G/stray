<blockquote><div class="section">1<br>THE METABOLIC</div><blockquote><p>It is possible that one of my first strays, apart from being gay, was to stray from photography. It was 1993 and I had just moved to New York City. I tore off one of the small frayed slips at the bottom of an advertisement on the community message board at P.S. 122 and soon after called Eileen Myles’s East Village apartment for the first time. A lot of artists and writers participated in Eileen’s poetry workshops in the ’90s, and many of us are still producing and publishing. Maggie Nelson even assembled a partial list of participants in her first book,</p><blockquote>WOMEN, THE NEW YORK SCHOOL, AND OTHER TRUE ABSTRACTIONS</blockquote><p>(University of Iowa Press, 2007). A couple of years ago I read Nelson’s chapter on Myles, “When We’re Alone in Public: The Metabolic Work of Eileen Myles,” and now recognize this essay as one of the catalysts for STRAY, a body of work I began in 2016.</p><p>Nelson captures the metabolic action in Myles’s writing and defines it in relationship to Myles themself as</p><blockquote>A POETRY ROOTED IN THE BODILY PRESENCE, IN THE FORCE AND RHYTHM OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR BODY.</blockquote><p>They go on to quote Myles:</p><blockquote>I THINK WE ALL WRITE OUR POEMS WITH OUR METABOLISM, OUR SEXUALITY . . . FOR ME A POEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IMAGINED BODY OF A SORT GETTING, THAT DOWN IN TIME.</blockquote><p>Nelson also grounds Myles’s writing in a notion of the outside that reminds me of Jack Spicer’s poetics—not just Spicer’s well-known idea that poems come from East Mars, some distant planet or energy mass that dictates to the poet, but his notion of a public that is civic.</p><p>As if from outside, the idea of seeking exchanges with poets called to me, along with an impulse to include in my work an encounter with how two poets read in the sonic, phonic, and tonal medium of sound.</p><blockquote>THE SERIAL POEM IS OFTEN LIKE A SERIES OF ROOMS WHERE THE LIGHTS GO ON AND OFF. IT IS ALSO A SEQUENCE OF ENERGIES WHICH BURN OUT, AND IT MAY, BY THE PATH IT TAKES, INCLUDE THE CONSTELLATED. THERE IS FURTHER A SPACIAL ANALOGY WITH SERIES MUSIC: THE VOICE OR TONGUE, THE TONE, OF THE POEMS SOUND INDIVIDUALLY, AS ALONE AND SMALL AS THE POET . . . BUT SOUNDED IN SERIES, IT ENTERS A FIELD. IN THIS WAY THE DICTATION AND THE SERIAL FORM JOIN TO BRING THE POET, [THEIR] VOICE, TONE AND STANCE INTO A DIMENSION WHERE [THEY] ARE EITHER LOST OR FOUND.

<blockquote><div class="section">3<br>TEMPLE HI LO</div><blockquote><p>Embankments along the Los Angeles freeways are home to sprawling encampments of city dwellers. Miles of uncultivated land, barren in winter and overgrown until serviced by the city in the spring and fall, these interstitial spaces provide outdoor refuge to people seeking temporary shelter.</p><p>Tents and other provisional dwellings populate the spaces until they overcrowd and become so dense with debris and human byproduct that the city moves in to clear them in time for its annual summer fire season, calling them a “health hazard” yet providing no real alternatives. For anyone who has lived in the city for some time, the emergence and clearance of these spaces—“tent cities,” as some refer to them—are a routinized part of the Los Angeles landscape, the humans and their itinerant dwellings coming and going like other items for clearance laid to waste in the SoCal sun.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>The highway that I lived off of for over fifteen years in Los Angeles was the 110 freeway. Built in 1952, it was quaint by comparison to most others, with just three narrow lanes in the northern part of its route. Often on my way downtown, the traffic would be touch and go, and I would sit idle along the freeway studying the tents for signs of life. One dwelling caught my eye and always held my attention. I studied it the most closely. The perimeter of its space was marked with flags, torn fabric in a random pattern of yellow and white on wooden dowels staked in the ground. Some flags were larger than others, but the space was organized following some kind of logic and it was a site that was active, actively changing and being cared for. It looked like a plan that someone was carrying out with intention, and I could never figure out if someone was living in the space or if it might serve some other purpose.</p><p>The day I drove the highway and discovered that this space had been cleared was shocking. It shouldn’t have been—the same thing happened every year, but who was ever ready for it, least of all the tents’ inhabitants? Like August Sander’s hauntingly titled portfolio from 1922</p><blockquote>THE LAST PEOPLE,</blockquote><p>these were the city’s most vulnerable: the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the abused, the damaged war veterans and victims of real-estate displacement and other untold traumas. The cops would swoop in and round everyone up under the cover of night, clearing humans with their mounting problems and belongings like brush. Later, whenever I drove past the site, I would wonder what became of the person whose project got demo’d.<br><br>Perhaps six months after this clearance, I noticed some flags which had gone up near the crest of a hillside along a different freeway. One flag was quite large and pink; other flags marked a perimeter with strands of glittery material that glinted in the sun. It was more difficult to observe the scene from my car this time—highway driving is not ideal for deciphering messages in the landscape—but after weeks of observation and mounting curiosity, I finally drove to find it in the Elysian Fields across from Dodger Stadium.</p><p>Finding the place was relatively easy since I knew what to look for. Small flags marked the way when I got to the top of the hill and parked my car to continue on foot. A small paved fire road served as a driveway of sorts, and after walking in about five hundred feet I was greeted by a temple altar with oranges and candles, some pieces of bread, and a man standing with a pushcart of flags, red ones this time. He was friendly when I spoke with him. I asked if he was the same person who’d made the space off the 110 freeway and with a heavy Thai accent he told me that he was, that what I’d seen there was the Home Temple and that this one here was the Ten Level Temple High and Low. He said it was <blockquote>TENFOLD, LEFT AND RIGHT</blockquote> with two white flags, two yellow, two black, and two pink flags, and that only once the flags are complete does he lay the foundation by tearing everything up so he can see which way to set the plan.</p><blockquote>THE FOUNDATION FOR THE TEN LEVEL TEMPLE IS CONNECTED TO EVERY PART OF THE LAND AND OF THE WORLD,</blockquote><p>he went on to say. It was hard to make sense of everything he was telling me, and the freeway below was no help. He said we could talk again if I came back, but although I tried several times, I never had the luck of encountering him again. He did warn me not to enter the temple, however. He said it was dangerous because of humans and animals and how they might inflict harm, and I reassured him that I would respect his wishes. I never did enter the space, as his warning felt like an omen.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

I'm thinking of Hope as a progenitor for all types of traitors—racial traitors, gender traitors, special traitors.

<!--
<p>Nathaniel Mackey, as told to Shannon Ebner, in Durham, North Carolina, 2018:<blockquote>The last poem in <blockquote>SEPTET FOR THE END OF TIME </blockquote>is called “Dogon Eclipse” and it’s in some way alluding to that whole business of the co-presence of light, of a star, and that which is eclipsed by its presence.<br><br>I wrote the first poem, “Capricorn Rising,” and I didn’t see it as the beginning of a series; it was going to be a poem that sat by itself. But over the weeks and months that followed, I found myself going back to the three-word opening: “I wake up . . .” Each of the poems begins with those three words, so there’s at least that amount of formal consistency and recurrence . . . [They] also have—at the level of theme or content, or declaration—some kind of wrestling with the notion of awakening, a kind of Gnostic awakening. This to me is kind of an oxymoron: How awake can you be in a world that’s asleep? And how sure can you be that you are awake when you feel that you’re awake? “I wake up” became plagued with all this uncertainty and doubt and question—one of the reasons, I think, that it had to be returned to and worked with again.</blockquote><br><br>Song of the Andoumboulou: 50 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8:47 min.<br><br>From <blockquote>SPLAY ANTHEM</blockquote><br><br><blockquote>SONG OF THE ANDOUMBOULOU</blockquote> is a long-form poem that runs alongside Mackey’s other long-form poem, “MU”. In his preface to <blockquote>SPLAY ANTHEM,</blockquote>Mackey announces that <blockquote>SONG</blockquote> and <blockquote>“MU”</blockquote>are “now [to be] understood as two and the same, each the other’s understudy. Each is the other, each is both . . . each is the other’s twin or contagion.” One place the poems evince this twinning is in their titles, which are both drawn from pieces of music. <blockquote>SONG OF THE ANDOUMBOULOU</blockquote> is based on the Dogon people’s song of the Andoumboulou, recorded in 1956 by François Di Dio. Mackey relates that, according to the liner notes of Di Dio’s <blockquote>LES DOGON,</blockquote>the “song of the Andoumboulou is addressed to the spirits. Part of the Dogon funeral rites, it begins with sticks marking time on a drum’s head.” Likewise,<blockquote>“MU”</blockquote>is named after trumpeter Don Cherry’s<blockquote>“MU”</blockquote>albums, recorded for the French label <blockquote>BYG ACTUEL</blockquote>in 1969.</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>Of the poems’ intertwining, Mackey writes: “The places named in the song of the Andoumboulou, set foot on by the deceased while alive but lost or taken away by death, could be called ‘Mu.’ Any longingly imagined, mourned or remembered place, time, state, or condition can be called ‘Mu.’”</blockquote></blockquote>

Valk struck up a conversation with Berryman when she overheard him talking with a friend about a record store across the street. Drawn to the charismatic sound of Berryman’s voice, she asked if he was a musician. He replied that, in fact, he was an actor. As the story goes, after seeing the</p><blockquote>EARLY SHAKER SPIRITUALS </blockquote><p>production, Berryman had drafted an email to Valk that he saved on his phone and then showed her on that fateful day in the tea shop. In the email, Berryman had suggested the Group produce another album interpretation, with Black prison work songs.</p><p>Berryman had been closely studying a 1965 vinyl album recorded by folklorist Bruce Jackson, and he wanted people to have the same feeling for the Black prison work songs as they did for the Shaker songs. And as it turned out, Valk had been thinking about developing a follow-up, “B-side” piece, but she didn’t want to do the same thing—she wanted to do something that would complement the first piece by continuing to engage American folklore.</p><p>After their tea-shop encounter, Valk and Berryman agreed to meet again. At their second meeting, she gave Berryman her blessings to make his own “record album interpretation,” but he wanted to develop the material into a Wooster Group production. Berryman expressed that he felt that he could not produce the show on his own, that he needed to learn directly from the Group’s methods and ways of doing things.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

But, for me, the women’s power was not the sort of female power envisioned by, say, feminist modernism: it was not liberated, inherent, and autonomous but channeled in an unobstructed flow from the original Shaker sisters whose voices breathed through them.

I heard that piece of music before I read the second book on the Dogon that I read,</p><blockquote>THE PALE FOX</blockquote><p>[by Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen], years later.</p><blockquote>THE PALE FOX</blockquote><p>is really a much more technical, anthropological text [than Griaule’s earlier book on the Dogon,</p><blockquote>CONVERSATIONS WITH OGOTEMMÊLI]</blockquote><p>—it’s this huge thing—and it spends a lot of time reproducing the marks that the Dogon make throughout their environment. These marks are part of their cosmology—they’re part of the <i>cosmogony</i> that they relate in their cosmology and mythology. This is interesting, coming out of West Africa, coming out of a place whose cultures and civilizations are thought of as oral, primarily. It’s interesting that this people, the Dogon, would put such an emphasis on the mark, the graphic, essentially on writing, as what brings the world into being and what sustains it. I was drawn to that. And the disclosure of that in</p><blockquote>THE PALE FOX </blockquote><p>kind of came together with the quality that I heard in the Dogon singer singing the song of the Andoumboulou, a very raspy quality of voice, as though things are being rubbed together. The word <i>abrasive</i>, I use. <i>Abrasion</i>, I keep using as well. Here’s the passage, just to put it on the record, as they say in the courts:</p><blockquote>Given the centrality of various forms of graphic inscription in Dogon cosmology, the cosmogonic potency and role of sign, figure, drawing, trace, diagram, outline, image, mark, design and so on (for all of which the Dogon use a careful, hairsplitting terminology), along with the strikingly tactile, abraded vocality, the grating, “graphic” tone and timbre of the song of the Andoumboulou itself, I couldn’t help thinking of the Andoumboulou as not simply a failed or flawed, earlier form of human being but a rough draft of human being, the work-in-progress we continue to be.</blockquote><p>So that becomes a kind of conceit that holds this too-much I’m trying to talk about, or <i>tries</i> to hold it in—kind of like, you know, the eight being held by the seven [in </p><blockquote>SEPTET FOR THE END OF TIME,</blockquote><p>a collection of eight poems]. It’s excessive. And I put <i>graphic</i>, the word <i>graphic</i>, in quotes, scare quotes, because I knew it was a stretch. I was really thinking of graphite, and the proper adjective would be <i>graphitic</i>. I knew that, but I didn’t want to say <i>graphitic</i>, I wanted to say <i>graphic</i>. I put it in scare quotes to show that I was, you know, doing something naughty.</p><p>. . . and you asking about it actually sent me back to the dictionary, because I wanted to see if <i>graphite</i> and <i>graphic</i> have some history in common, some etymology, stuff like that. And I guess graphite comes out of the graphic, in that it’s, you know, a material that can be used for writing, so it relates to the graphic in that sense. And I thought about it a bit more and I was thinking that—I actually took some notes on my little iPhone Notepad. What did I say?</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>“Graphite is soft carbon. Were it hard enough to withstand contact and remain totally self-contained, it would not be useful for writing. Graphite gives up some of itself upon contact with paper. Graphite suffers a loss that leaves a mark.” So, the music I’m talking about, the writing I’m talking about, is talking about loss that leaves a mark. And not just talking about it; it <i>is</i> the mark that’s left. So, the “graphic tone,” which one can talk about in relationship to various media, is that. A sense of vulnerability, of not being self-contained or totally self-contained, of being soft enough to leave a trace or a mark of loss, is what’s in the song of the Andoumboulou, which after all is a funeral song, a song of mourning, a song of loss. It’s elegiac. Whether one is talking about <i>graphic</i> in the illustrative sense, that something is <i>graphic</i> in that it’s visual and it conveys a clear picture—but I didn’t want that sense of it so much. I wanted the sense of almost a kind of synesthetic tactility that is graphic, maybe that trades between visual and tactile, visual and haptic.</p><p>There’s a lot of figuration that comes up in my writing that has to do with this: a lot of reference to cloth, things like burlap, that kind of stuff; sand, abrasion; rough as opposed to smooth. The title of my first book of criticism,</p><blockquote>DISCREPANT ENGAGEMENT </blockquote><p>[Cambridge University Press, 1993], is getting at something like, again, an imperfect fit that necessarily then has some rub and some play in it. And that play can be sound, it can be a mark, a scratch, something like that, and <i>tone</i> in the largest sense—you know, in the way that we can talk about the tone of audible material, the tone of visible material. All of that I was thinking about. And I know it’s of interest to you because you work in a visual medium. How do we get the graphic, the visual, to have tone, a musical quality?</p><p>I remember that when I was young, when I was a kid and I was really into the visual arts, the media I liked most was charcoal and pastels. There was just something about the tactility of them. I mean, watercolors I was no good at. Things ran too much. But with charcoal and pastels, they gave you some resistance that the water didn’t, that the watercolor didn’t, and I liked that, the resistantness of the material. And <i>rub</i> is a word that comes up in my work a lot—you know, in the sense, along with all the others, of “there’s the rub,” in that sense of a qualification or a limit or a drawback, that kind of thing. I thought about that a lot in that statement. The dyes that the Dogon use are rough rather than smooth, coarse, wet powder that then dries. <i>That</i> quality. At one point the first volume of</p><blockquote>FROM A BROKEN BOTTLE TRACES OF PERFUME STILL EMANATE </blockquote><p>[New Directions, 2010] talks about N., the narrator, having seen a canvas by Irving Petlin, who’s an artist who works in paints, in oil and stuff, but for a long time worked in pastels. I had seen one of his canvases at Robert Duncan’s house in San Francisco, my introduction to his work. I felt there was something very strongly graphic about it, in this other sense of <i>graphic</i>—not just pictorial, but tactile, haptic. It gave a sense of scratch and rub and hoarseness, a kind of gruffness about it.</p><p>Those are the tonalities, when you go into the realm of sound, that are so much a part of my listening habits, whether we’re talking about Ben Webster and his recourse to subtones, where the sound has a kind of sandpaper quality to it, as breath escapes, or flamenco, which is an old, abiding book of instruction for me, especially the singing, <i>cante jondo</i>. The raspy voice is the voice of truth in <i>cante jondo</i>. When you get there, you have what they call “duende,” and Garcia Lorca in that great essay of his talks about that.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>So, you can see how this is like one of those figures that just never stops signifying. [<i>Laughs</i>] You know? You can’t get it to stop! You can walk into any room of it and, you know, it’s like all the walls are lined with books; it’s just got so much stuff to it. You opened up a huge can of worms when you asked me about “a graphic tone,” and, you know, I have to resort to that old blues line: “Don’t start me talking …” Anyway, it’s kind of a conundrum that has fascinated me, how sound can do that kind of work, how a canvas can do that kind of work, how poetry can do that kind of work—certain voices, just the look of the poem on the page at times? As you know from reading my work, graphic display is very important to me. I do think that there’s a way in which the poem on the page speaks and signifies before we’ve even read it or heard it read. So, you know, I’m trying to wander around in that and try some things and do some things and find out some things about that and, yes, “graphic tone” may be one of the ways of summing up this whole multifaceted thing that I’m interested in and that I try to get my work to do.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
