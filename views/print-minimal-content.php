	<blockquote><span class="section">1</span><br>THE METABOLIC<br><blockquote>It is possible that one of my first strays, apart from being gay, was to stray from photography. It was 1993 and I had just moved to New York City. I tore off one of the small frayed slips at the bottom of an advertisement on the community message board at P.S. 122 and soon after called Eileen Myles’s East Village apartment for the first time. A lot of artists and writers participated in Eileen’s poetry workshops in the ’90s and many of us are still producing and publishing. Maggie Nelson even assembled a partial list of participants in her first book,&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>WOMEN, THE NEW YORK SCHOOL, AND OTHER TRUE ABSTRACTIONS&nbsp;</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>(University of Iowa Press, 2007). A couple of years ago I read Nelson’s chapter on Myles, “When We’re Alone in Public: The Metabolic Work of Eileen Myles,” and now recognize this essay as one of the catalysts for STRAY, a body of work I began in 2016.&nbsp;<br>Nelson captures the metabolic action in Myles’s writing and defines it in relationship to Myles herself as “a poetry rooted in the bodily presence, in the force and rhythm of her own particular body.” She goes on to quote Myles: “I think we all write our poems with our metabolism, our sexuality . . . for me a poem has always been an imagined body of a sort, getting that down in time.” Nelson also grounds Myles’s writing in a notion of the outside that reminds me of Jack Spicer’s poetics—not just Spicer’s well-known idea that poems come from East Mars, some distant planet or energy mass that dictates to the poet, but his notion of a public that is civic.&nbsp;<br>As if from outside, the idea of seeking exchanges with poets called to me, along with an impulse to include in my exhibition an encounter with how two poets read in the sonic, phonic, and tonal medium of sound.&nbsp;</blockquote></blockquote>

	<blockquote><span class="section">3</span><br>TEMPLE HI LO<br><blockquote>Embankments along the Los Angeles freeways are home to sprawling encampments of city dwellers. Miles of uncultivated land, barren in winter and overgrown until serviced by the city in the spring and fall, these interstitial spaces provide outdoor refuge to people seeking temporary shelter. &nbsp;<br>Tents and other provisional or temporary dwellings populate the spaces until they overcrowd and become so dense with debris and human byproduct that the city moves in to clear them in time for its annual summer fire season, calling them a “health hazard” yet providing no real alternatives. For anyone who has lived in the city for some time, the emergence and clearance of these spaces—tent cities, as some refer to them—are a routinized part of the Los Angeles landscape, the humans and their itinerant dwellings coming and going like other items for clearance laid to waste in the SoCal sun.<br>The highway that I lived off of for over fifteen years in Los Angeles was the 110 freeway. Built in 1952, it was quaint by comparison to most others, with just three narrow lanes in the northern part of its route, the route where I had a home. Often on my way downtown, the traffic would be touch and go, and I would sit idle along the freeway studying the tents for signs of life. One dwelling caught my eye and always held my attention. I studied it the most closely. The perimeter of its space was marked with flags, torn fabric in a random pattern of yellow and white on wooden dowels staked in the ground. Some flags were larger than others, but the space was organized following some kind of logic and it was a site that was active, actively changing and being cared for. It looked like a plan that someone was carrying out with intention, and I could never figure out if someone was living in the space or if it might serve some other purpose.<br>The day I drove the highway and discovered that this space had been cleared with all the other temporary dwellings was shocking. It shouldn’t have been—the same thing happened every year, but who was ever ready for it, least of all the tents’ inhabitants? Like Sander’s hauntingly titled portfolio <blockquote>THE LAST PEOPLE, </blockquote>these were the city’s most vulnerable people: the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the abused, the damaged war veterans and victims of real-estate displacement and other untold traumas. The cops would swoop in and round everyone up under the cover of night, clearing humans with their mounting problems and belongings like brush. Later, whenever I drove past the site of the flag structure, I would wonder what became of the person whose project got demo’d. Had they started over elsewhere? How had they begun living again now?<br>Perhaps six months after this clearance, I noticed some flags which had gone up near the crest of a hillside along a different freeway. One flag was quite large and pink; other flags marked a perimeter with strands of glittery material that glinted in the sun. It was more difficult to observe the scene from my car this time—highway driving is not ideal for deciphering messages in the landscape—but after weeks of observation and mounting curiosity, I finally drove to find it in the Elysian Fields across from Dodger Stadium. <br>Finding the place was relatively easy since I knew what to look for. Small flags marked the way when I got to the top of the hill and parked my car to continue on foot. A small paved fire road served as a driveway of sorts, and after walking in about five hundred feet I was greeted by a temple altar with oranges and candles, some pieces of bread, and a man standing with a pushcart of flags, red ones this time. He was friendly when I spoke with him. I asked if he was the same person who’d made the space off the 110 freeway and with a heavy Thai accent he told me that he was, that what I’d seen there was the Home Temple and that this one here was the Ten Level Temple High and Low. He said it was “tenfold, left and right,” with two white flags, two yellow, two black, and two pink flags, and that only once the flags are complete does he lay the foundation by tearing everything up so he can see which way to set the plan. “The foundation for the Ten Level Temple is connected to every part of the land and of the world,” he went on to say. It was hard to make sense of everything he was telling me, and the freeway below was no help. He said we could talk again if I came back, but although I tried several times, I never had the luck of encountering him again. He did warn me not to enter the temple, however. He said it was dangerous because of humans and animals, and I reassured him that I would respect his wishes. I never did enter the space, his warning felt like an omen.</blockquote></blockquote>
	<blockquote><span class="section">4</span><br>CIRCULAR TIME<br><blockquote>According to Wikipedia, asynchronous communication is the transmission of data that is not beholden to an external clock signal. Data on this path travels intermittently instead of steadily streaming, which makes it possible to communicate at variable bit rates rather than at regular intervals.&nbsp;<br>In this form of telecommunication, transmitter and receiver clock generators are not exactly synchronized all of the time. Data can be sent one byte at a time, with each byte preceded by a start bit and a stop bit.<br>Photography communicates mimetically using the apparatus of a camera or lens of some sort to copy the time that it sees, reduplicating it and stamping one time in-frame for another time out-of-frame.&nbsp;<br>Frames of images are frames of time, and frames of breath, suspended. Photography can also speak in the time frame of the index. One mark of exposure here may be called by another as an indexible mark there. The picture holds an interval of time as a mark-er of re-corded time.<br>But what about other forms of time, such as asynchronous time or circular time? What about time that rotates or time that spins? Are there other types of time that pictures can hold?<blockquote>INDEFINITE TIME, INDETERMINATE TIME, DISPLACED TIME, ABSTRACT TIME, BILATERAL TIME, TRANSMISSION TIME, TRANSDUCED TIME</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
	<blockquote><span class="section">5</span><br>STRAY<br><blockquote>Classified under: nouns denoting people.<br>In 1990, Susan Howe published <blockquote><a href="javascript:popup('appendix/susan-howe')">SINGULARITIES</a></blockquote>(Wesleyan University Press), which contains the poem “Articulation of Sound Forms in Time” as bursts of verse and found textual artifacts spread out over thirty-eight pages. On poetic time, Howe says this:<blockquote>WHEN YOU WRITE A POEM YOU USE SOUNDS AND WORDS OUTSIDE TIME. YOU USE TIMELESS ARTICULATIONS.</blockquote>In 2002, Nathaniel Mackey published <blockquote>SPLAY ANTHEM</blockquote>(New Directions), which includes the poem “Song of the Andoumboulou: 50,” one unit of a serial poem that he began writing in 1985 and first published in the volume ERODING WITNESS (University of Illinois Press). <blockquote><a href="javascript:popup('appendix/nathaniel-mackey')">SONG OF THE ANDOUMBOULOU</a></blockquote> has been published in units over the past few decades, and currently comprises 250 units and counting. In Mackey’s essay “Sound and Sentiment, Sound and Symbol,” he speaks of a kind of broken time: <blockquote>POETIC LANGUAGE IS LANGUAGE OWNING UP TO BEING AN ORPHAN, TO ITS TENUOUS KINSHIP WITH THE THINGS IT OSTENSIBLY REFERS TO. </blockquote>I came across this piece of writing in the book <blockquote>THE POLITICS OF POETIC FORM: POETRY AND PUBLIC POLICY </blockquote>(ROOF Books, 1990), where writings by Howe and Mackey coexist, albeit incidentally.<blockquote>STRAY IN TWO PARTS: LEFT: Susan Howe, Articulation of Sound Forms in Time” from <blockquote>SINGULARITIES</blockquote> (Wesleyan University Press), 1990.

	<blockquote><span class="section">6</span><br>FRIENDS IN DEED HOUSE<br><blockquote>Since 1894, <blockquote>FRIENDS IN DEED </blockquote>has been serving the homeless and at-risk communities of Pasadena, California. An interfaith organization, it works to meet basic human needs by providing supportive services so that homeless and at-risk neighbors can rebuild their lives.&nbsp;<br>A seal on the organization’s website shows two brown hands, palms facing inward and fingers pointed upward to catch a green leaf falling from an imaginary sky above. The seal designates FRIENDS IN DEED a “trauma informed organization.”&nbsp;<br>The Centers for Disease Control has published an infographic on the <blockquote>6 GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO A TRAUMA-INFORMED APPROACH </blockquote>to care during public health emergencies, where each of these six principles is represented by a symbol:<br>1. Safety (a house, home, or shelter)<br>2. Trustworthiness &amp; Transparency (two hands clasping)<br>3. Peer Support (four interlocking hands)<br>4. Collaboration &amp; Mutuality (multiple bodies side-by-side)<br>5. Empowerment, Voice, &amp; Choice (an ear that is listening)<br>6. Cultural, Historical, &amp; Gender Issues (shaking hands embedded in puzzle pieces)<br>An asterisk after the final word of <blockquote>FRIENDS IN DEED </blockquote>on the organization’s website leads to the additional message:&nbsp;<br>“Doing together what we cannot do alone”<br>In Brent Hayes Edwards’s essay “Notes on Poetics Regarding Mackey’s ‘Song,’” he talks about Mackey’s long-form poem as an embodied experience that makes “unstable progress down the page, its blanks and breaks, the creak of its reprises.” He goes on to reference the influence of the Dogon [people’s] cosmology on Mackey’s writing by quoting the French ethnologist Geneviève Calame-Griaule, whose&nbsp;<br>work on door-lock mechanisms in Dogon culture, has noted that: “In Dogon, as in some other African languages, the terms expressing the notions of ‘to open’ and ‘to close’ come from a single root whose first meaning is ‘to close’ . . . . Since it is the simple root that connotes the idea of ‘to close,’ and the derived form that of ‘to open,’ it seems legitimate to argue that the concept of closing precedes that of opening, and that one cannot, in Dogon logic, open a door until it has previously been closed. It seems that western logic proceeds more in the opposite sense, and considers that one closes that which is open, essentially in order to protect it.”<br>Edwards then concludes that “If Mackey’s Song creatively embraces the complexities of Dogon cosmology, then part of what the serial poem finds there is a sense that things close in order to open.”<blockquote>FRIENDS IN DEED </blockquote>gallery in San Francisco was founded in 2019 by Micki Meng with Eric Li and Nazli Ercan.&nbsp;<br>The translation of the gallery’s Chinese name, 想得開藝廊:<blockquote>YOU CAN THINK OPEN A PROBLEM TO SOLVE IT</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
	<blockquote><span class="section">7</span><br>GRACE WALKING AND TALKING<br><blockquote>Cyrus Grace Dunham to Shannon Ebner, via email, January 13, 2017:<br>I've been thinking quite a bit about Hope (Atherton) as a trans subject—not via gender, necessarily (though I'm of course drawn to the ambiguity of this "male" character having a feminine name), but via the transgressing of borders that were established in colonial America, and were central to the colonial project. I'm thinking of Hope as a progenitor for all types of traitors—racial traitors, gender traitors, special traitors. And, to me, “trans” is always just a placeholder for a "crossing," not a crossing from one shore to another but perhaps an indefinite one, without arrival, without completion.&nbsp;<br>I’m sick of using the word “trans”—it's too loaded, too current in its signification— and "crossing," which is really the route of any transition, feels like a much more truthful representation of what it means to take the risk of leaving some norm behind, hoping toward an alternative.&nbsp;</blockquote></blockquote>

	<blockquote><span class="section">11</span><br>TREE ELLIPSES OR THE HOT WAR COUPLE<br><blockquote>The seventeenth-century reverend Hope Atherton and&nbsp;<br>the Kaluli myth of the boy who turned into a Muni bird.<br>Susan Howe, from <blockquote>SINGULARITIES</blockquote>:<br>In our culture Hope is a name we give women. Signifying desire, trust, promise, does her name prophetically engender pacification of the feminine?<br>Pre-revolution Americans viewed America as the land of Hope.<br>“The Reverend Hope Atherton, minister of the gospel, at Hatfield, a gentleman of publick spirit, accompanied the army.”<br>Hope’s baptism of fire.

He became lost in the woods during a disorderly retreat from that fight, but managed to return safely. The legend was that while he was lost the Indians refused to take him prisoner because he was hallucinating. On his return he told a strange tale of his miraculous salvation, which was not believed by his neighbors. His gravestone is missing.<br>Nathaniel Mackey, from “Sound and Sentiment, Sound and Symbol”:<br>The words of the song the boy who becomes a muni bird resorts to are different from those of ordinary speech. Song language, “amplifies, multiplies, or intensifies the relationship of the word to its referent.”</blockquote></blockquote>
