<div><span class = 'allcaps'><b class = 'title'>A SIDE / B SIDE</b></span></div><div>Since 1975 the Performing Garage has been home to The Wooster Group. An experimental theater company, they refer to themselves in the third-person simply as The Group. The Group is comprised of core founding members, and along with a rotating cast of performers, advisors, technicians and company administrators, they have been a staple of postmodern theater in the New York downtown art scene for the past five decades and counting.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Wooster Group’s founding director, Elizabeth LeCompte is a media savant, known for performing exorcisms on plays by the likes of Will Shakespeare, Eugene O’Neill, Gertrude Stein, Bertolt Brecht and the early plays of the late Spalding Gray, another founding member.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>No text is safe in LeCompte’s hands. A self-described THIEF of language, LeCompte and The Group appropriate, plagiarize and steal when developing productions. Performing a type of highly mediated stage-craft, experiencing any one of The Wooster Group’s productions is a full body, full mind, and full sensory experience.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In 2014, The Wooster Group added a new play to their repertoire called <span class = 'allcaps'>EARLY SHAKER SPIRITUALS, A RECORD ALBUM INTERPRETATION</span>. An overnight sensation, the play was directed by founding member and often lead actor Kate Valk. As a longtime audience member of The Group’s work, when the new play was announced with Valk as its director, I was intrigued by the anomaly and the turning of roles within the company’s structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And this turning of roles continued into 2017, when another record album interpretation came into the mix called <span class = 'allcaps'>THE B SIDE: NEGRO FOLKLORE FROM TEXAS STATE PRISONS</span>. The material for <span class = 'allcaps'>THE B SIDE</span> was introduced to Valk by the young Black actor Eric Berryman.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In a story that has been widely circulated, Berryman had a chance encounter with Valk at a tea shop in the East Village where he happened to be working at the time. Valk struck up a conversation with Berryman when she overheard him talking with a friend about a record store across the street. Drawn to the charismatic sound of Berryman’s voice, she asked if he was a musician. He replied that in fact he was actor.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As the story goes, after seeing The Shaker Spirituals production, Berryman drafted an email to Valk that was saved on his phone and which he showed her on that fateful day in the tea shop. In the email Berryman tells her that he thought The Group should produce another record album interpretation only this time with Black prison work-songs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Berryman had been closely studying a 1965 vinyl album, recorded by folklorist Bruce Jackson, and he wanted people to have the same feeling for the Black prison work-song music as they did for the Shaker music. And as it turned out, Valk had been thinking about developing a follow-up B-side piece, but she didn’t want to do the same thing again, she wanted to do something that would be a compliment to the first piece by continuing to engage American folklore.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>After the tea shop encounter Valk and Berryman agreed to meet again. At the second meeting, she gave Berryman her blessings to make his own record album interpretation but he wanted something else. He wanted to develop the material into a Wooster Group production. Berryman expressed that he felt that he could not do it on his own, that he needed to learn from them directly, from The Group’s methods and ways of doing things.</div><div><br></div><div>This chance encounter resulted in The Wooster Group’s theater diptych:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div class = 'allcaps'><span>TWO PLAYS ABOUT AMERICAN FOLKLORE DRAWN OUT</span>&nbsp;<br><span>OVER TIME AND SPACE</span><br><span>ONE BLACK AND ONE WHITE DISCREPANTLY ENGAGING</span><br><span>AS NATHANIEL MACKEY WOULD CALL IT</span><br><br><span>BOTH RECORD ALBUM INTERPRETATIONS BOTH REAL AND IMAGINED</span><br><br><span>WALK THROUGH ONE DOOR&nbsp; INTO A CIRCLE IN A SQUARE</span>&nbsp;<br><span>INTO THE EARLY SHAKER SPIRITUALS A RITUAL COMMUNITY</span>&nbsp;<br><span>OF CAST OUTS FROM THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND FOR PRACTICING THEIR RADICAL BELIEFS SCORNED AND THREATENED THEY RESETTLED IN THE NEW AMERICAN WILDERNESS OF THE 18TH CENTURY SEEKING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN ECSTATIC SONG AND DANCE TO UNSETTLE AND UNRESTRELIGEOUS FORM.</span><br><br><span>WALK THROUGH ANOTHER DOOR INTO ANOTHER CIRCLE</span>&nbsp;<br><span>INSIDE ANOTHER SQUARE IN THE BLACK BOX THEATER</span><br><span>AND ENTER THE B SIDE: NEGRO FOLKLORE FROM TEXAS STATE PRISONS.

I asked if I could visit The Performing Garage on Wooster Street to speak with her about photographing the stage sets for both plays. I wasn’t sure the how or the what of it, but absent of the actors themselves I knew that I wanted to study the sets through images and send them back out into the world as a photographic diptych to see if there was anymore work to be done there.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But there were other things too, all the things that could never be photographed, all the things that don’t record and won’t register: <span class = 'allcaps'>THE SENSATIONS</span> and <span class = 'allcaps'>THE TRANSDUCTIONS</span>, bodies in space, performing as living instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div class = 'allcaps'><span>TRANSDUCTION AS IT RELATES TO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL FOLLOWS THESE PRINCIPAL STEPS OF SENSORY PROCESSING:</span><br><br><span>SIGNAL (SUN OR LP) + COLLECTION (EYE OR CAMERA OR EAR) + TRANSDUCTION (NERVOUS SYSTEM) + PROCESSING (LISTENING) + ACTION (SONG).</span></div>
