<div><b>THE SEVEN SLEEPERS</b>&nbsp;</div><div>derives its title from one of three epigraphs found in Nathaniel Mackey’s chapbook SEPTET FOR THE END OF TIME (1983).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The&nbsp; passage tells a story from the Koran chapter 18 about a group of youths seeking refuge in a cave while escaping religious persecution. The number of sleepers in the cave, as well as the amount of time they slept there, is unknown. While the sleepers were thought to have awoken after three years, it is more likely they slept 300 years or longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div class="image_anchor"></div><div class="image_anchor"></div><div class="image_anchor"></div><div><b>Additional recordings of the American poet Nathaniel Mackey are playing in the garden at 30-minute intervals.</b></div><div><br></div><div><b>Dogon Eclipse . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2:01 min.</b></div><div>From SEPTET FOR THE END OF TIME, (Boneset), 1983</div><div><br></div><div>“The last poem in SEPTET FOR THE END OF TIME is called ‘Dogon Eclipse’ and it’s in some way alluding to that whole business of the co-presence of light, of a star, and that which is eclipsed by its presence.”</div><div><br></div><div>I wrote the first poem, ‘Capricorn Rising’, and I didn’t see it as the beginning of a series; it was going to be a poem that sat by itself. But over the weeks and months that followed, I found myself going back to the three-word opening: ‘I wake up…’. Each of the poems begins with those three words, so there’s at least that amount of formal consistency and recurrence . . . [They] also have—at the level of theme or content, or declaration—some kind of wrestling with the notion of awakening, a kind of Gnostic awakening.’ This to me is kind of an oxymoron: how awake can you be in a world that’s asleep? And how sure can you be that you are awake when you feel that you’re awake? ‘I wake up’ became plagued with all this uncertainty and doubt and question—one of the reasons, I think, that it had to be returned to and worked with again.”</div><div><br></div><div><b>Song of the Andoumboulou: 50 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8:47 min.</b></div><div>From SPLAY ANTHEM, (New Directions), 2006</div><div><br></div><div>Song of the Andoumboulou is a long-form poem that runs alongside Mackey’s other long-form poem, <i>‘Mu’</i>. In his preface to SPLAY ANTHEM, Mackey announces that Song and <i>‘Mu’</i> are ‘now [to be] understood as two and the same, each the other’s understudy. Each is the other, each is both … each is the other’s twin or contagion.’ One place the poems evince this twinning is in their titles, which are both drawn from pieces of music. Song of the Andoumboulou is based on the Dogon people’s song of the Andoumboulou, recorded in 1956 by François Di Dio. Mackey relates that, according to the liner notes of Di Dio’s Les Dogon, the ‘song of the Andoumboulou is addressed to the spirits. Part of the Dogon funeral rites, it begins with sticks marking time on a drum’s head.’ Likewise, <i>‘Mu’</i> is named after trumpeter Don Cherry’s <i>‘Mu’</i> albums, recorded for the French label BYG Actuel in 1969. Of the poems’ intertwining, Mackey writes: ‘The places named in the song of the Andoumboulou, set foot on by the deceased while alive but lost or taken away by death, could be called “Mu”. Any longingly imagined, mourned or remembered place, time, state, or condition can be called “Mu”.’ At the time of this interview, Mackey says his ‘latest, and yet still far longer, “Songs”, have a different measure,’ that he thinks of the serial form that his poems (and fiction) have taken as ‘accumulative, building its vocabulary as it goes’. As he explains, ‘it’s this recursive-ness that is part of the poem’s form … the more I write the more I have to draw from’.</div><div><br></div><div><i>— Nathaniel Mackey as told to Shannon Ebner&nbsp;</i></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
