<div>It is possible that one of my first strays, apart from being gay, was to stray from photography. It was 1993 and I had just moved to New York City. I tore off one of the small fraying slips at the bottom of an advertisement on the community message board at P.S. 122 and soon after called Eileen Myles’s East Village apartment for the first time. A lot of artists and writers participated in Eileen’s poetry workshops in the ’90s and many of us are still producing and publishing. Maggie Nelson even assembled a partial list of participants in her first book, <span class = 'allcaps'>WOMEN, THE NEW YORK SCHOOL, AND OTHER TRUE ABSTRACTIONS</span>. A couple of years ago I read Nelson’s chapter on Myles, “When We’re Alone in Public: The Metabolic Work of Eileen Myles,” and now recognize this essay as one of the catalysts for <span class = 'allcaps'>STRAY</span>.</div>
<br>
<div>Nelson captures the metabolic action in Myles’s writing and defines it in relationship to Myles herself as “a poetry rooted in the bodily presence, in the force and rhythm of her own particular body.” She goes on to quote Myles: “I think we all write our poems with our metabolism, our sexuality. . . for me a poem has always been an imagined body of a sort, getting that down in time.” Nelson also grounds Myles’s writing in a notion of the outside that reminds me of Jack Spicer’s poetics—not just Spicer’s well-known idea that poems come from East Mars, some distant planet or energy mass that dictates to the poet, but his notion of a public that is civic.&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div>As if from outside, the idea of seeking exchanges with poets called to me, along with an impulse to include in my exhibition an encounter with how two poets read in the sonic, phonic, and tonal medium of sound.&nbsp;</div>

<div><span class = 'allcaps title'><b>TEMPLE HI LO</b></span></div><div>Embankments along the Los Angeles freeways are home to sprawling encampments of city dwellers.&nbsp; Miles of uncultivated land, barren in winters, and overgrown until serviced by the city in the spring and fall, these interstitial spaces provide outdoor refuge to people seeking temporary shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div>Tents and other provisional forms of temporary dwellings populate the spaces until they overcrowd and become so dense with debris and human bi-product that the city moves in to clear them in time for its annual summer fire season siting the reason as ’health hazard’ yet providing no real alternatives.&nbsp; For anyone who has lived in the city for some time, the emergence and clearance of these spaces, tent cities as some refer to them, are a routinized part of the Los Angeles landscape, the humans and their itinerant dwellings come and go like other items for clearance laid to waste in the so cal sun.</div><br><div>The highway that I lived off of for over fifteen years in Los Angeles was the 110 freeway.&nbsp; Built in 1952, it was quant by comparison to most others, with just three narrow lanes in the northern parts of its route, the route where I had a home.&nbsp; Often on my way downtown the traffic would be touch and go and I would sit idle alongside the freeway studying the tent life for signs of humans.&nbsp; There was one dwelling that caught my eye and always held my attention. I studied it the most closely.&nbsp; It marked the perimeter of its space using flags, torn fabric in a random pattern of yellow and white on wooden dowels staked in the ground.&nbsp; Some flags were larger than others but the space was organized following some kind of logic and it was a site that was active, actively changing and being cared for, it looked like a plan that someone was carrying out with intention, and I could never figure out if someone was living in the space or if it might serve some other purpose.</div><br><div>The day I rode the highway and discovered it was cleared with all the other temporary dwellings was shocking.&nbsp; It shouldn’t have been, the same thing would happen every year but who was ever ready for it, least of all its inhabitants.&nbsp; Like Sander’s hauntingly titled portfolio ‘The Last People’ — these were the city’s most vulnerable people — the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the abused, the damaged war veterans and victims of real state displacement and other untold traumas.&nbsp; The cops would swoop in and round up everyone, clearing humans with their mounting problems and belongings like brush under cover of the night.&nbsp; Whenever I drove past the space I would wonder what came of the person who’s project got demo’d, would they start over elsewhere, how would they begin living again now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div>Perhaps six months after this clearance I noticed that along a different freeway some flags went up near the crest of a hillside.&nbsp; One flag was quite large and pink, other flags marked a perimeter along with strands of glittery material that held a glint in the sun.&nbsp; It was more difficult to observe the scene from the car this time, highways at high speed are not ideal for deciphering messages in the landscape but after weeks of observation and mounting curiosity I drove to find it in the Elysian Fields across from Dodger Stadium.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div>Finding the place was relatively easy as long as you knew what to look for.&nbsp; Small flags marked the way when I got to the top of the hill and parked the car along the road to be on foot.&nbsp; A small paved fire road served as a driveway of sorts and after walking in about 500 feet I was greeted by a temple alter with oranges and candles, some pieces of bread, and a man standing with a push cart with flags, red ones this time.&nbsp; He was friendly when I spoke with him.&nbsp; I asked if he was the same person that made the space off the 110 freeway and with a heavy Thai accent he told me that he was, that what I saw was the “Home Temple” and that this one here in the Elysian Fields was a “Ten Level Temple High and Low”.&nbsp; He said it was “ten-fold-left-and-right” with two white flags, two yellow, two black and two pink flags and that only once the flags are complete does he lay the foundation by taring everything up so he can see which way to set the plan.&nbsp; “The foundation for the Ten Level Temple was connected to every part of the land and to the world” he went on to say.&nbsp; It was hard to make sense of everything he was telling me and the freeway below was no help.&nbsp; He said we could talk again if I came back only I never had the luck of encountering him again even though I tried several times.&nbsp; He did warn me not to go into the temple though, he said it was dangerous because of humans and animals, and I reassured him that I would obey his wishes and not enter.&nbsp; I never did, to do so felt like a bad omen.</div><br><div><span class = 'allcaps title'><b>STRAY</b></span></div><div>According to Wiki, asynchronous communication is the transmission of data that is not beholden to an external clock signal.

It seems that western logic proceeds more in the opposite sense, and considers that one closes that which is open, essentially in order to protect it.”</div><br><div>Edwards then concludes that “If Mackey’s Song creatively embraces the complexities of Dogon cosmology, then part of what the serial poem finds there is a sense that things close in order to open.”</div><br><div><span class = 'allcaps'>FRIENDS IN DEED</span> gallery in San Francisco which was founded in 2019 by Micki Meng with Eric Li and Nazli Ercan.&nbsp;</div><br><div>The translation of the gallery’s Chinese name 想得開藝廊 is:&nbsp;</div><br><div>You can think open a problem to solve it.</div><br><div><span class = 'allcaps'><b>GRACE WALKING AND TALKING</b></span></div><div>&nbsp;An excerpt from a letter on January 13, 2017:</div><br><div>I've been thinking quite a bit about Hope (Atherton) as a trans subject – not via gender, necessarily (though I'm of course drawn to the ambiguity of this "male" character having&nbsp; feminine name), but via the transgressing of borders that were established in colonial America, and were central to the colonial project. I'm thinking of Hope as a progenitor for all types of traitors – racial traitors, gender traitors, special traitors. And, to me, trans is always just a place-holder for a "crossing," not a crossing from one shore to another but perhaps an indefinite one, without arrival, without completion.&nbsp;</div><br><div>I’m sick of using the word trans – it's too loaded, too current in its signification – and "crossing," which is really the route of any transition, feels like a much more truthful representation of what it means to take the risk of leaving some norm behind, hoping towards an alternative.&nbsp;</div><br><div>- Cyrus Dunham</div><br><div><span class = 'allcaps'><b>BOMBARDO</b></span></div><div>The poet Susan Howe references this made-up Native-American word in her book <span class = 'allcaps'>MY EMILY DICKINSON</span>, published in 1985.
