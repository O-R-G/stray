<div><b>A GRAPHIC TONE</b></div><div><br></div><div>Nathaniel Mackey as told to Shannon Ebner in Durham, North Carolina, 2018:</div><div><br></div><div>In the preface [SPLAY ANTHEM, NEW DIRECTIONS (2006)] I was trying to talk about probably too many things. I mean, I was trying to talk about and in some ways kind of explain to myself why this one piece of music that I heard in the early 70s, this Dogon funeral song called the song of the Andoumboulou, had grabbed hold of me and kept hold of me in the way it had. I was trying to think about and talk about that particular sonority and I kept thinking that I heard something graphic in it. I heard that piece of music before I read the second book on the Dogon that I read, <i>The Pale Fox</i>, years later. <i>The Pale Fox</i> is really a much more technical, anthropological text—it’s this huge thing—and it spends a lot of time reproducing the marks that the Dogon make throughout their environment. These marks are part of their cosmology, they’re part of the cosmogony that they relate in their cosmology and mythology. This is interesting, coming out of West Africa, coming out of a place whose cultures and civilizations are thought of as oral, primarily. It’s interesting that this people, the Dogon, would put such an emphasis on the mark, the graphic, essentially on writing, as what brings the world into being and what sustains it. I was drawn to that. And the disclosure of that in <i>The Pale Fox</i> kind of came together with the quality that I heard in the Dogon singer singing the song of the Andoumboulou, a very raspy quality of voice, as though things are being rubbed together. The word abrasive I use. A<i>brasion</i> I keep using as well. Here’s the passage, just to put it on the record, as they say in the courts:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div class="indent_block">Given the centrality of various forms of graphic inscription in Dogon cosmology, the cosmogonic potency and role of <span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>sign, figure, drawing, trace, diagram, outline, image, mark, design and so on (for all of which the Dogon use a <span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>careful, hairsplitting terminology), along with the strikingly tactile, abraded vocality, the grating, ‘graphic’ tone and <span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>timbre of the song of the Andoumboulou itself, I couldn’t help thinking of the Andoumboulou as not simply a failed or <span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>flawed, earlier form of human being but a rough draft of human being, the work-in-progress we continue to be.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So that becomes a kind of conceit that holds this too-much I’m trying to talk about, or tries to hold it in—kind of like, you know, the eight being held by the seven. It’s excessive. And I put <i>graphic</i>, the word <i>graphic</i>, in quotes, scare quotes, because I knew it was a stretch. I was really thinking of graphite, and the proper adjective would be <i>graphitic</i>. I knew that, but I didn’t want to say <i>graphitic</i>, I wanted to say <i>graphic</i>. I put it in scare quotes to show that I was, you know, doing something naughty.</div><div><br></div><div>… and you asking about it actually sent me back to the dictionary, because I wanted to see if <i>graphite</i> and <i>graphic</i> have some history in common, some etymology, stuff like that. And I guess graphite comes out of the graphic, in that it’s, you know, a material that can be used for writing, so it relates to the graphic in that sense. And I thought about it a bit more and I was thinking that—I actually took some notes on my little iPhone Notepad. What did I say? ‘Graphite is soft carbon. Were it hard enough to withstand contact and remain totally self-contained, it would not be useful for writing. Graphite gives up some of itself upon contact with paper. Graphite suffers a loss that leaves a mark.’ So, the music I’m talking about, the writing I’m talking about, is talking about loss that leaves a mark. And not just talking about it; it is the mark that’s left. So, the ‘graphic tone’, which one can talk about in relationship to various media, is that. A sense of vulnerability, of not being self-contained or totally self-contained, of being soft enough to leave a trace or a mark of loss, is what’s in the song of the Andoumboulou, which after all is a funeral song, a song of mourning, a song of loss. It’s elegiac. Whether one is talking about <i>graphic</i> in the illustrative sense, that something is <i>graphic</i> in that it’s visual and it conveys a clear picture—but I didn’t want that sense of it so much. I wanted the sense of almost a kind of synesthetic tactility that is graphic, maybe that trades between visual and tactile, visual and haptic.</div><div><br></div><div>There’s a lot of figuration that comes up in my writing that has to do with this: a lot of reference to cloth, things like burlap, that kind of stuff; sand, abrasion; rough as opposed to smooth. The title of my first book of criticism, <i>Discrepant Engagement</i>, is getting at something like, again, an imperfect fit that necessarily then has some rub and some play in it. And that play can be sound, it can be a mark, a scratch, something like that, and <i>tone</i> in the largest sense—you know, in the way that we can talk about the tone of audible material, the tone of visible material. All of that I was thinking about. And I know it’s of interest to you because you work in a visual medium. How do we get the graphic, the visual, to have tone, a musical quality?</div><div><br></div><div>I remember that when I was young, when I was a kid and I was really into the visual arts, the media I liked most was charcoal and pastels. There was just something about the tactility of them. I mean, watercolors I was no good at. Things ran too much. But with charcoal and pastels, they gave you some resistance that the water didn’t, that the watercolor didn’t, and I liked that, the resistant-ness of the material. And <i>rub</i> is a word that comes up in my work a lot—you know, in the sense, along with all the others, of ‘there’s the rub’, in that sense of a qualification or a limit or a drawback, that kind of thing. I thought about that a lot in that statement. The dyes that the Dogon use are rough rather than smooth, coarse, wet powder that then dries. <i>That</i> quality. At one point the first volume of <i>From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate</i> talks about N., the narrator, having seen a canvas by Irving Petlin, who’s an artist who works in paints, in oil and stuff, but for a long time worked in pastels. I had seen one of his canvases at Robert Duncan’s house in San Francisco, my introduction to his work. I felt there was something very strongly graphic about it, in this other sense of <i>graphic</i>—not just pictorial, but tactile, haptic. It gave a sense of scratch and rub and hoarseness, a kind of gruffness about it.</div><div><br></div><div>Those are the tonalities, when you go into the realm of sound, that are so much a part of my listening habits, whether we’re talking about Ben Webster and his recourse to sub-tones, where the sound has a kind of sandpaper quality to it, as breath escapes, or flamenco, which is an old, abiding book of instruction for me, especially the singing, <i>cante jondo</i>. The raspy voice is the voice of truth in <i>cante jondo</i>. When you get there, you have what they call <i>duende</i>, and Garcia Lorca in that great essay of his talks about that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, you can see how this is like one of those figures that just never stops signifying. [<i>Laughs</i>] You know? You can’t get it to stop! You can walk into any room of it and, you know, it’s like all the walls are lined with books; it’s just got so much stuff to it. You opened up a huge can of worms when you asked me about ‘a graphic tone’, and, you know, I have to resort to that old blues line: ‘Don’t start me talking…’ Anyway, it’s kind of a conundrum that has fascinated me, how sound can do that kind of work, how a canvas can do that kind of work, how poetry can do that kind of work—certain voices, just the look of the poem on the page at times? As you know from reading my work, graphic display is very important to me. I do think that there’s a way in which the poem on the page speaks and signifies before we’ve even read it or heard it read. So, you know, I’m trying to wander around in that and try some things and do some things and find out some things about that and, yes, ‘graphic tone’ may be one of the ways of summing up this whole multifaceted thing that I’m interested in and that I try to get my work to do.</div>
