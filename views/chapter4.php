<div><span class = 'allcaps'><b class = 'title'>SPLAY ANTHEM</b></span></div><div>Sometime in the early aughts, I thought it would be funny to run around Los Angeles with a 35mm camera holding a small sign in front of the lens baring these two words:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div class="serif allcaps"><span>AMERICAN</span><br><span>PHOTO -</span><br><span>GRAPHS</span></div><br><div>the name of a photography book, that is also an essay, and that was published in 1938 by Walker Evans, photography’s paternal figure extraordinaire.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Still new to the city, I went out to photograph the places around town that I kept noticing by car and which took up similar vernacular tropes to Evans magnum opus — car culture, found language, the gasoline station, architecture, and instead of the churches riddled all over the streets of Evans’ book, I went to former Jewish section in East Los Angeles, which is where I happened to be living at the time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>City Terrace was adjacent to Boyle Heights, an area that would later be subject to decries of gentrification and artist whitewashing as a gallery scene emerged that threatened to displace the Latinx and Japanese American communities it had been home to after the Jews and Blacks relocated to other western parts of the city in the 40s and 50s. The site I photographed in Boyle Heights was a boarded up and scaffolded brick building, a shul called Talmud Torah Synagogue, built in 1923. A void at the top of the building where the shape of a Torah had once been revealed its former identity as a Jewish site of worship.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I also recalled that I photographed a woman living on the street outside a corporate copy shop in the mid-Wilshire district. This was a complete taboo for anyone such as myself, who came of age in the bright lights and long shadows of postmodernism’s maternal order, but I did it anyways. It was as if holding the sign was a mask for the ghosts of Evans, the broken conscience of Martha Rosler, and some version of myself that embodied all three of us, but poorly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It was a short-lived project in which I only photographed three rolls of film and have but a few scanned files to show for it. I never made actual prints from the scans but nevertheless they are images I return to like an old notebook looking for evidence of something.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps it is simply that the images are the first indication of a love-hate relationship that I would come to develop with Walker Evans, a figure who as a student I always dismissed outright, finding the work dull, unemotive and overrated by the male photography educators that most alienated my sensibilities and intellectual curiosities as a young queer artist coming of age during the Reagan years and <span class = 'allcaps'>AIDS</span> crises.</div><div><br></div><div>As for the sign, it went into semi-retirement for a handful of years until I pulled it from a pile of things and propped it onto the wall of my studio one day. It lived like that, commenting on everything and nothing in its peripheral vision, until I photographed it as its own thing, an act which by default makes it a new thing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div class="serif allcaps"><span>SOIL</span><br><span>EROS -</span><br><span>ION</span></div><br>

<div>In 2017, while preparing for a group show I curated called <span class = 'allcaps'>SOIL EROSION</span>, I started to embark on more research about Evans. The show was inspired by the juxtaposition of two images and two sets of words. The first was an 11 x 14 inch silver gelatin print that I had purchased from the Library of Congress of Evans <span class = 'allcaps'>FSA</span> work. It was categorically titled <span class = 'allcaps'>SOIL EROSION</span> and was taken in 1936 somewhere in the vicinity of Jackson, Mississippi. Evans worked on the <span class = 'allcaps'>FSA</span> project for brief periods of time between the years of 1935 to 1938.&nbsp; Geographically speaking, he mostly concentrated his efforts in the southeastern United States with the exception of New York City, the coal mining towns of West Virginia and industrial towns of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; The southeastern towns were comprised of Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, and South Carolina. The photograph I selected was part of a larger collection that showed ‘towns and farms in Mississippi from 1935-1936.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In addition to evidence of soil erosion due to floods, there are also images of farmers, farm scenes, a railroad station, Victorian houses, general stores, storefronts, signage, and a collection of images referred to as “negro quarters” which were former slave quarters in Tupelo, Mississippi that show houses, street scenes, and an image of Black children on barren farm land. At least one or more of these images made it into <span class = 'allcaps'>AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHS</span>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second image the show pivoted around was from a former college classmate named Seth Rubin, circa 1991. Double exposed by the camera and underexposed in the printing process, the body in the image was rendered almost featureless with its cause of action unclear. Whereas most of the images that Rubin made at the time depicted him naked and rolling in mud, in this image he appeared twice on a pile of felled branches, laying just above the soil line. The photograph always haunted me, existing somewhere between the prefix of the word erosion, <span class = 'allcaps'>EROS</span>, and its opposite — <span class = 'allcaps'>THE DEATH DRIVE</span>, with its suffix — <span class = 'allcaps'>ION</span>, denoting <span class = 'allcaps'>ACTION</span> or <span class = 'allcaps'>CONDITION</span>, <span class = 'allcaps'>COMMUNION</span> or <span class = 'allcaps'>UNION</span>.</div><div><br></div>

<div>Perhaps one of the most consequential discoveries I made during the time I was preparing for <span class = 'allcaps'>SOIL EROSION</span>, was from an archived lecture that I stumbled upon. Testing the whereabout of the eros, in Evans work, and after reading some letters that Evans had written to a male colleague in which he continually disparaged a string of aggrieved relationships with women, I found myself wondering about the nature of Evans sexuality, if what I was perceiving was a textbook example of closeted behaviorisms, not to mention the subtexts of certain images that longingly looked at other male subjects.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Was Evans infamous alienation, really just a beard for his own latent homosexuality? It suddenly seemed so visible that I turned to the internet with my query and to my surprise it sent me to the distinguished art historianJohn Tagg, and a lecture that he had delivered, called:</div><div><br></div><div class = 'allcaps'><span>KNOCKING AROUND BETWEEN MONEY, SEX, AND BOREDOM: WALKER EVANS IN HAVANA AND NEW YORK</span></div><div><br></div><div>Tagg’s lecture was delivered on location at Yale Center for British Art and The Yale University Art Gallery where he was a visiting scholar at the time. When I wrote Tagg to ask him about the lecture and share my mutual intrigue, he thanked me for my response:</div><div><br></div><div class = 'allcaps'><span>NOT LEAST SINCE THE YALE LECTURE ATTRACTED ITS SHARE OF OUTRAGE AND HATE MAIL. PERHAPS IT WAS TOO PROVOCATIVE FOR FORMER STUDENTS AND COLLEAGUES, RIGHT THERE WHERE HE HAD TAUGHT. YET, IT IS IN FACT THE HAGIOGRAPHIC VIEW OF EVANS THAT DIMINISHES HIM, RATHER THAN THE ATTEMPT TO PURSUE WHAT HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE APPROVED ENGAGEMENT WITH HIS PHOTOGRAPHS. HE IS SIMPLY NOT THE MONOLITHIC MORAL PARAGON OTHERS INVENTED––AND THAT, FOR ME, MAKES HIS WORK STRANGER AND MORE COMPELLING.</span><br><br><span>*</span><br><br><span>THE ORIGINAL CALL FOR SOIL EROSION SOUGHT TO MANEUVER AROUND ITS TITLE. IT SPOKE OF STATES EROSIONS, CLIMATE EROSIONS, CULTURAL EROSIONS AND SOCIAL EROSIONS.</span><br><br><span>SOIL AS LAND, BODY AND SOILING.</span><br><br><span>EROSION AS EROS, LOSS AND DESIRE AND ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR NEW CLEARINGS.</span><br><br><span>IN THE DAYS, WEEKS AND NOW YEARS FOLLOWING THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THIS PHRASEOLOGY HAS ENTERED SHIFTING LANDSCAPES THAT WITH EACH PASSING DAY GROW MORE AND MORE UNIMAGINABLE, WHERE ANY IDEA OF GROUND OR GROUNDING IS UNCLEAR AT BEST.</span><br><br><span>TAKEN TOGETHER, THE WORK IN SOIL EROSION IS A COLLECTION OF THESE STARTING POINTS PLACED IN A LARGER NARRATIVE FIELD WHERE MEANING PLUS THE CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR LIVING CONDITIONS GO TO WORK ON EACH OTHER TO CAST DOUBT AND SHORE UP NEW CERTAINTIES.</span></div>
